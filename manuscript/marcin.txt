# Marcin Floryan: #NoLearning

![Sketchnote](images/originals/marcin.jpg)

![slide 01](images/marcin/Marcin01.png)

Marcin Floryan: No, this is not a picture of me, this is a picture of my friend, Ian. 

![slide 02](images/marcin/Marcin02.png)

I’ve worked with Ian a few years ago and I was, oh no, look at Ian again, we were doing an Agile transformation and I was really new into this stuff so I would go to all the conferences and I would read all the books and I would do to Ian who is slightly more experienced and would say "Ian, look at this book, do you know how much I’ve learned?" and Ian would listen to me very patiently and then would go "Ok, so what have you changed?" And I would go "  No, no! I’ve learnt all this stuff. I’m yet to change everything, but it’s fascinating learning’’ and then I would go to a conference and I would go to Ian and I would say "Ian, look at all these stuff that I’ve learnt!" and he would go "Hm. So what have you changed?" And really I did not understand what he mean. But hopefully thought the talk today we’ll try to explore that and find the answer to that question, what did Ian mean?

![slide 03](images/marcin/Marcin03.png)

So, some years after that I went to work for an organization called Emergen and for about a year we were trying to build an educational product. And at that point a really, really had to delve into what is it that we mean by learning and how do we learn best. This is just one of the books that we’ve produced as a part of that one year effort. But it really started opening my mind to what might have been the question that Ian was asking me.

![slide 04](images/marcin/Marcin04.png)

Right, my name is Marcin Floryan, you can find some of my thoughts on that blog. I currently work for this little furry animal. 

![slide 05](images/marcin/Marcin05.png)

Actually no I don’t. 

![slide 06](images/marcin/Marcin06.png)

I work for a company named "Compare the market". 

![slide 07](images/marcin/Marcin07.png)

And I’ve got a little question for you to start up with. So, who of the people who are here thinks that you are paid exclusively to learn? Right? Do you want to raise your hand if you think that’s the case. Right. I can see 1, 2 hands up. Don’t worry I was prepared for that.

So, let me ask you another question. When you start a project, how many of you know exactly what the end result will look like? All right. Nobody. So when you start a project how do you know exactly what set of requirements you will implement? Nobody again? So when you start a project how many of you know, before you start how many production servers there are going to be? I can’t believe it, nobody is raising their hand over here!

So, for me the process of going from the state where you don’t know something to the state where you actually know how many servers are in production, what you have built and what requirements you’ve implemented, I call that "Learning".

We live in software development land which is products development for me. Learning is what we do, going from an unknown to known and I would say that all of you here are paid exclusively to learn. Because learning is what we do every single day, even if we don’t recognize that.

![slide 08](images/marcin/Marcin08.png)

So I thought it was really brave of Paul to invite me here and I will ask him to cover his ears now because I’m going to tell you: today you are not going to learn anything. Ignore that. I’ll tell you more in this conference you are not going to learn a single thing, and this is not because the speakers aren’t good, they’re excellent, right? They’re the best you can get. Let’s try to explore. Why might I’ll be trying to put through that heresy. 

![slide 09](images/marcin/Marcin09.png)

And for that we need some great philosophers and I like how Russ started us and let’s go back to the ancient Greeks. I cannot teach anybody anything. I can only make them think and then to Socrates’ kind of quote, Plutarch had a beautiful explanation why that is the case. 

![slide 10](images/marcin/Marcin10.png)

For the correct analogy for the mind "It’s not a vessel that needs filling, but a wood that needs igniting." Right. I’m hoping to ignite a few branches tonight.

So, in order to learn and to actually battle this no learning problem we need three things. 

![slide 11](images/marcin/Marcin11.png)

We need a pencil, some cogs and a thumbs-up. Makes sense? No, no of course not!

So, what I would like to show with you today and if that’s the take away you take, that’s it, we’re done. 

![slide 12](images/marcin/Marcin12.png)

Learning to be effective needs to be primed, deliberate and validated. 

![slide 13](images/marcin/Marcin13.png)

Ok? Let’s explore what that means. 

![slide 14](images/marcin/Marcin14.png)

Primed learning: so, very, very early on as human beings discovered that there is this land that we live on and there are all of these oceans that we would like to explore and there are actually more oceans than the land. So we started kind of sailing out, further and further away. Until we actually built ships big enough so that we can sail from one land to the other. And that was beautiful but unfortunately we realized that it was a little problem as we started sailing further and further away. That was the problem.

![slide 15](images/marcin/Marcin15.png)

Usually, on an average length crew voyage, half of the crew would die of scurvy. If it is estimated that between 1500 and 1850 about 2 million people died if scurvy, 2 million sailors. So rather a big problem. 

![slide 16](images/marcin/Marcin16.png)

So here is Lord Anson who took a bunch of ships for 3 years naval expedition to fight the Spanish and on his expedition, on these beautiful ships he took about 2000 men, all right? 

![slide 17](images/marcin/Marcin17.png)

So I would like all of you to stand up now, to try to kind of emphasize what happened with this men. So we’ve already been standby up a lot so I’ll ask to do it again, please, right? Stand up everyone, please. You represent 2000 sailors, the 2000 sailors that sailed with Lord Anson for three years, right? Now, how many of you think come back home? I would like you sit down if you think you made it home, all right? Some people are sitting down so what I’m going to ask you is, I’ll tell you. It was 600 of them. A third made it home, right? So let’s make this a third of the room, you guys can sit down, please. The rest of you, I’m really sorry, you didn’t make it, ok? But there is one good outcome. You went fighting so even though you died, it might have been honorable death if you actually managed to kind of fight some enemies. So, how many of you people standing you think actually died in battle? How many do you think should be standing? How many of you should be sitting down? So, all of you just sat down, please stand up again. Three men died in battle, all the rest died of scurvy. Thank you very much, sit down, please!

Now of course, I’ve asked to stand up and sit down to kind of experience this a little bit but you already know. We only did this little exercise so your brains got a little bit more oxygen so you can actually absorb this talk a little bit better.

![slide 18](images/marcin/Marcin18.png)

So here comes James Lind, a Scottish guy who was trying to actually find the problems and he was the first guy who did clinical experiments. He took sailors who were suffering from scurvy and he divided them into nice little pairs. And each pair would be fed with different food. And he found out that one pair who would get citrus fruit was almost instantly cured of scurvy. Right? So, what he did, he shared that with everyone and what people did: that can be the food, we’ll ignore that! 

![slide 19](images/marcin/Marcin19.png)

So there’s James Cook, right? Two big expeditions about 1750-1760. 

![slide 20](images/marcin/Marcin20.png)

He takes a ship, sales around the world, discovers Australia, comes back home, people think: "Wow, he’s a great man!" He goes away, takes his beautiful ship, sales around the world, comes back home and guess what? 

![slide 21](images/marcin/Marcin21.png)

Not a single man dies of scurvy. Ok? Everyone’s surprised what James could do. 

![slide 22](images/marcin/Marcin22.png)

Well he had plenty of this on board, that was carrot marmalade and he had plenty of this, some sauerkraut. 

![slide 23](images/marcin/Marcin23.png)

So, actually he took all the things he thought might influence this, but you know what? 

![slide 24](images/marcin/Marcin24.png)

Actually no learning, Cook got a medal for it, but the rest of the navy just ignored that outcome and for another 60 to 100 years people kept dying out of scurvy because they didn’t have the right food when they were sailing.

![slide 25](images/marcin/Marcin25.png)

This is Vienna General Hospital around 1840, ok? 

![slide 26](images/marcin/Marcin26.png)

And there were 2 clinics in which babies were born. So, you think, you know, there were just some experimentations with the sailors and some observations. So, let’s look what happens when we have data. Clinic one: this is mortality rate of mothers who are trying to give birth in those 2 clinics. Which of two clinics would you rather give birth to a child in? Right? I bet it would be the second one, right? 

![slide 27](images/marcin/Marcin27.png)

And there was one guy working there, Ignaz Semmelweis, a doctor, a physician who was trying to really crack this problem. He was really, really uncomfortable that in one of the clinics the mothers would die much more than in the other one. So what he did, he tried to experiment and see what was the difference and it took some months and years to discover. But eventually one of his friends died because he was stabbed by a scalpel by one of the students. The difference between the two clinics is one had students that were being taught medicine, the other didn’t. And in the clinic where the students were being taught medicine they would go from the autopsies to the mothers who were giving birth. Semmelweis went "How about if you guys did this? 

![slide 28](images/marcin/Marcin28.png)

Just wash your hands, see what happens. This is what happened. 

![slide 29](images/marcin/Marcin29.png)

This is the mortality rate. Dropped off the cliff! Right? Fantastic!

![slide 30](images/marcin/Marcin30.png)

I’m really sorry. Do you know what happened to the guy? He got fired! Because the physicians could not bear the fact that they could have unclean hands. That was completely out of their mind, it was completely so out there. So he goes somewhere else, to other hospital, where he tries to repeat the experiment. The results are exactly the same. So what does the other hospital do? They put him into a mental institution where he dies. 

![slide 31](images/marcin/Marcin31.png)

No learning there. So after Semmelweis we have this idea of Semmelweis reflex which is our instant reflex to reject any ideas that do not fit with what we’ve already learnt. This is why we don’t know. Right?

![slide 32](images/marcin/Marcin32.png)

So what does it look like in software? Here is Kent Beck, and this is his quote about 20 years ago about functional language: "In spite of their conceptual and mathematical elegance, functional programming languages never caught on for commercial software." They’re dead. Anyone doing JavaScript today? See the life!

![slide 33](images/marcin/Marcin33.png)

So, you know, one of the reasons why we’re not learning is because it is impossible for anyone to begin to learn that which he thinks he already knows. How often do we think we already know these things? 

![slide 34](images/marcin/Marcin34.png)

So, learning to be effective needs to be primed, that means you need to be prepared, you need to have plans. You’re learning before you start.

![slide 35](images/marcin/Marcin35.png)

Anyone knows what this is? Looks like a spreadsheet. It is a spreadsheet and I borrowed it from Jurgen Appelo, and this is the spreadsheet that Jurgen prepares to track his learning when he’s writing a book. You think that’s his spreadsheet? That’s what it really is! 

![slide 36](images/marcin/Marcin36.png)

That’s how detailed he really is about his preparation. Right! 

![slide 37](images/marcin/Marcin37.png)

So learning to be effective needs to be primed, deliberate, validated.

![slide 38](images/marcin/Marcin38.png)

Let’s look at deliberate learning. 

![slide 39](images/marcin/Marcin39.png)

My daughter is learning how to do ice skating and she’s doing these lessons enough to after a set of lessons she goes to next level. And to go to the next level she needs to have completed a number of exercises. So, after she was about to go from level 2 to level 3 and the teacher said "You are really good, but you need to do this one exercise better to go to level 3." So we go together on ice and she goes and tries to do some more exercise and what I see her do? She’s doing all the exercises she already knows how to do, not the one her teacher told her to improve on. Ok?

Anyone’s seen a developer’s CV where it says 10 years of Java experience? Ok. They’re doing the same thing over and over again. 10 years wasn’t enough to realize that Java was the dead end something, no disrespect to any Java developers. You can put any language you want in there.

![slide 40](images/marcin/Marcin40.png)

So actually, what we need is not just practice, we need deliberate practice. And the difference between normal practice and deliberate practice is that we practice not what were good at, this is what you’re going to do, just working on your code every day, it is the deliberate practice which is practicing the things we are actually not good at, putting effort into improving our skills and our performance.

![slide 41](images/marcin/Marcin41.png)

So, there is a gentleman called Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi. A little bit of Hungarian notation there for you. 

![slide 42](images/marcin/Marcin42.png)

He came up with this idea of flow and this is how he was trying to explain what this deliberate practice is. So, the deliberate practice occurs when the relationship of your existing skills and the challenges you face is just right. Not too difficult, not too easy, because if your challenges are too simple for the skills you have, you are just bored. But if the challenges are too difficult for the skills that you have, you get so much anxiety, you can’t do anything. You have to find the right sweet spot.

![slide 43](images/marcin/Marcin43.png)

I’ve been talking a lot about practice but when people say about learning they usually don’t necessarily mean practice, they often mean knowledge, right? So, obviously mastery of the knowledge alone isn’t sufficient. We have to have both. And this is the one thing that I really learn at VFQ. 

![slide 44](images/marcin/Marcin44.png)

That for our learning to be effective we have to do both: theory and practice and I’m just going to put it here in front of you and  I encourage you to go and research that a little bit more. This is something called "Kolb Learning Cycle" and that’s all the universities using today to teach their students. What they’re saying is in order for you to learn, you have to go though the whole cycle. And the cycle you can start it wherever you want. Usually it starts with some concrete experience you’ve done something, you’ve heard something. Then you have some reflective observation, right? You do abstract conceptualization so you turn what you saw in what you think is a model in your head and then you do some active experimentation on that subject. This is why you guys cannot learn anything today, because there’s no way you can go thought the whole cycle, just during the conference. Hopefully you’ll get a lot of ideas, but you have to think about them and you have to put them into action.

![slide 45](images/marcin/Marcin45.png)

Now Epictetus also tells us something important about this deliberate learning. Now this is translated from Greek and even in English it doesn’t make sense, so what he really said is "If you want to do something, just go and do it, but if you want to stop doing something, you have to start doing something else." We are really bad at unlearning things. Children are brilliant learners because they don’t have unlearn anything and we’ve not usually in that comfortable position.

![slide 46](images/marcin/Marcin46.png)

So, I have a little story for you to illustrate that. A long, long time ago there was a beautiful castle and in that castle lived a king. 

![slide 47](images/marcin/Marcin47.png)

And that king had an alchemist as many kings would, right? And why would the king keep the alchemist in his castle? Because he was hoping that the alchemist would find the right formula for turning whatever iron, ore into gold. But the alchemist kept failing so the king get really anxious and goes "Now, that’s it, you have 6 months to come with the formula so I can actually get my gold." So, the alchemist goes away, thinks about it and says "Dear king, dear king I think I have found your formula. This is your formula but in order to get your gold you have to follow this formula really, really carefully, step by step, on your own. But remember, the most important thing of all, when you’re doing that you have to remember never, ever to think about the dragon that lives under the castle."

![slide 48](images/marcin/Marcin48.png)


![slide 49](images/marcin/Marcin49.png)

So I’m going to set some expectations and I’m glad that I’ve already seen this curve twice. As you go into deliberate practice, as you start your learning you are going to go from here, down here and up here. And the poor Java developer that I was referring to earlier probably sat over here. Never made the jump to the next level. And this looks very beautiful but in practice it won’t look like this. So, this is an example of Jerry Weinberg tracking his pinball abilities over many, many years and his improvements.

![slide 50](images/marcin/Marcin50.png)

This is what the graph really looks like. And that’s what you should be prepared for, that’s what you should expect when you go learning something. 

![slide 51](images/marcin/Marcin51.png)

So, learning to be effective needs to be primed, deliberate, validated.

![slide 52](images/marcin/Marcin52.png)

Let’s talk about validated learning. 

![slide 53](images/marcin/Marcin53.png)

My children have quite a few books and for some strange, strange reason every night when I go and read a story for them, out of all the books that they have they pick just the one. 

![slide 54](images/marcin/Marcin54.png)

And I open the book and I sit with them and I’ll read "Who lives inside this little house? It’s Toeffl all alone, poor Toeffl doesn’t quite notice how lonely he’s grown." And on, and on, and on it goes and every time I make a mistake my children know I’ve made a mistake. And if I close the book and I try that and try to memorize this, no chance. 

![slide 55](images/marcin/Marcin55.png)

However, there’s this book and this book I can just read even now, even today after 20 years. Foreign language. I think many of you might remember that. So what’s the difference between the book that I read for six months every night to my children I can’t remember it and a little poem that I read 20 years ago and I can still recite it here in front of you even though I'm still shaking nervous, right?

What is the difference? The validation. I had to read this in front of a teacher, I was tested on it. Fortunately my children only test me slightly on the book that I read to them every night about Toeffl. 

![slide 56](images/marcin/Marcin56.png)

The important thing that we’re trying to battle here when we try to get our confirmation, our validation of the learning is the confirmation bias which is our natural tendency to confirm what we think is true. We read a book, we think it had some really good ideas, "hey, Presto, I’ve learned it, right?" So how do we confirm these things, how do we make sure that it’s not just me who thinks it is the case. Olaf was talking about how do you get someone else to help you out. 

![slide 57](images/marcin/Marcin57.png)

Some experiments with psychology students about training, it turns out that if you take students, put them through training one team and another group of students doesn’t get the same training. Even if their training is worthless, the students who went through the training will remember that it has improved their abilities, their skills and that they had done better after the training. Even if there is no observable difference, confirmation biased.

![slide 58](images/marcin/Marcin58.png)

Another think we’ve trying to fight here is something called the Dunning-Krugen effect which says that if we don’t know that much, if we’re not really very good, we tend to overestimate our abilities. Novice developers will think they’re better than they really are. However, season really good developers will tend to underestimate their abilities and apparently this is tied to the fact that the young, novice developers overestimate their own ability but the season developers will overestimate other’s abilities. 

![slide 59](images/marcin/Marcin59.png)

And we have to remember that our memory is a save on read memory, is save on recall. If we want to remember something we have to recall something, but not only just repeat it, but actually try to recall it and use it in a context. Get that practical element into your learning.

![slide 60](images/marcin/Marcin60.png)

All right! Any questions? No, no, I’m not allowing you for questions now. We’ll have the open space for that. Questions are a very important thing, a very important way to validate your learning. And how many of you will be asking questions and how often would you like to ask a questions and you don’t? How many of you have been thought at school not a query your teachers? Not to ask them any questions?


![slide 61](images/marcin/Marcin61.png)

So, going back to Ian, now I understand why he was asking me "What have you changed?" because he wanted me to really learn and he already understood that true learning takes the full process and then only by demonstrating that I have done something with my learning. Only when I do that, only when I change something can I truly say that I’ve learned. 

![slide 62](images/marcin/Marcin62.png)

All right? Do you guys remember? Primed, deliberate and validated. Repetition is good.  Primed, deliberate and validated. Effective learning.

![slide 63](images/marcin/Marcin63.png)

So, I’m going to finish up with this theory of learning entropy and this is just my idea. So, what I’ve been doing just now was this: these are the ideas that I’ve been knowing towards you. That is not learning, that is just a random piece of blocks that I’ll have to pick up later on. But in order to actually build something from his blocks I would have to put some energy, some effort into it and I want you guys to remember that you have to put effort your learning in order to build something from the random facts that arrive into your brains. All right? 

![slide 64](images/marcin/Marcin64.png)

So for me, when I started on this journey and I wanted to share my ideas about learning one very important validation would be to actually come up here and share those ideas with me. So I’m here because I’m trying to validate my learning about learning and I’m going to finish with this great quote from Seth Godin: 

![slide 65](images/marcin/Marcin65.png) 

"If you’ve done something with what you’ve learned, then maybe you know it".

![slide 66](images/marcin/Marcin66.png)

Primed, deliberate, validated. 

![slide 67](images/marcin/Marcin67.png)

Maybe. 

![slide 68](images/marcin/Marcin68.png)

Thank you very much!
