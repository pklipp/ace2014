# Paweł Brodziński: Culture: The forgotten bit

![Sketchnote](images/originals/pawel.jpg)

PawelHello everyone! So, talking about culture I’m going to use this word like 100 times during the next 30 minutes. So you know it’s important after this session. And it’s not going to be kind of super, super, super practical because when we are touching culture, it’s very contextual but I want to tell you why it’s important and how to tackle the culture in your own, in your own contexts.

Let me start with, let me start with that. John Kotter in 1999 basing on his research said “About 70% of all major change programs fail.”  And by that time it was no new news. It was the same for quite some time. 20 years later we are here, 20 years later and if you look at research around success rates of change programs, it hasn’t moved a bit. It’s the same for more than 40 years already. It’s, we are failing 70 to 90% of the time. There is one interesting perspective to those statistics. For the past 15 years we have seen a huge rise of Agile and Lean, approaches that directly aim to improve the way we work, to change the way we work and they don’t seem to have impact on those numbers at all. Now, there is an obvious question “Why?” and my answer to that question would be that we focus too much on practices, tools, techniques, methods. We are looking for recipes. This is my experience from ACE! conferences over the years we would frequently talk about “Ok. Give me recipe how I should change my team.” Well, it doesn’t work. What we should be paying more attention to is what’s beyond practices. What is the mindset of people who are adopting a change? What are the principles they follow? What are the values that they share? And when I’m talking about mindsets, value, these principles, I cannot help but bring organizational culture to discussion. 

So, we define organizational culture as a sum of behaviors of people within an organization. And not only behavior but also what drives those behaviors. So, we would have visions, values, beliefs, norms, systems, so anything that forms those behaviors, those every day, those every day behaviors. When we are talking about culture versus practices, there’s a very interesting experiment that I’ve run recently. During Kanban Leadership Retreat I run a workshop, by the way Kanban Leadership Retreat is an event where once a year leaders of Global Lean Kanban Community would go to discuss the state of the tools we have, to try to improve those. So, they run their workshop around failed changes and why we failed with those changed programs. And this is the end result of that workshop. So, whatever you see on the picture and it’s more to the left, it’s more related to culture. If it’s more to the right, it’s more related to practice. Now, this picture has two parts. The top part are root causes of failures. So, we start we fail, failure stories and then we try to find why we failed. And then, we distributed those sticky notes on the scale. So, any sticky note that is more to the left, it’s like, it tells a story like “we lock the proper culture”. And if it’s more to the right, it says the story like “we lock the proper practices”. Now, the bottom part is about solutions. So, once knowing what failed, we try to find solutions for those issues. And again, more to the left something is, it’s more about addressing the cultural problems, more to the right something is, it’s addressing more the problem of practices. Now, I see a problem here. This picture is heavy on those two areas which basically tells us that we understand, that the majority of issues that make our change programs fail are related to culture. At the same time, majority of tools and solutions that we have it’s all about practices.

I see slight balance here. And then we tell that it’s not the result of random Agile cultures, these are people who are pushing the envelope of Global Lean Kanban Community, community that has evolutionary change painted on its banners in a big fonts. So, there is a huge problem here.

So,   when we are talking about culture, probably, sooner or later, this thing will pop up which is culture hacking. And I consider that a dangerous thing because the way it is most frequently understood is like” Let’s change something here and see what happens.” The way we hack some code. Now, the difference is you’re not playing with code here. You’re playing with humans, with their beliefs, with their behaviors and there’s no way back. If you change people’s behavior usually there’s no going back to the old way of how they were behaving. So it’s very risky. 

I would much prefer a more structured approach which is PDCA cycle, for example. PDCA comes from plan, do, change, act. So, the plan part is defining a hypothesis. If I change something, I expect some kind of result. Now, it’s not only defining a hypothesis, it’s also defining how we are going to measure whether the hypothesis is right or wrong. So how we are going, when and how we are going to tell whether the experiment worked or didn’t. Only then we start to implement the actual experiment. And then we check its results and then we act on those results designing the next experiment because it goes, it goes one after the other. The important part is not really learning that’s the experiment or the hypothesis was proved or disproved. The important part is understanding, is understanding what’s changing in our organization, how we can act for our organization, how we can influence that change. And by the way, the same thing is true for practices. So this is another outcome of Kanban Leadership which is basically just stealing some of the ideas that were connected which basically says that if we understand the practices we use, we will learn. If we apply them in kind of mindless way we risk that we will end up in doing some sort of cargo cult. 

So, let me use an example to explain that. It’s morning, you need some physical exercises. So, please stand up, everyone who does stand-up, some sort of stand-ups in your team. I would assume that most of you will stand up. Yes, stand-ups, stand-ups are the most prevalent Agile practice. Now, keep standing, don’t sit down. Keep standing if you ask yourself and your teams explicitly, explicitly why you are doing stand-ups. So what kind of value you are getting from stand-ups. Keep standing if you have this discussion with your team explicitly. It’s nothing bad. Ok. The rest of you keep standing if you ask yourself and your teams explicitly, again explicitly, what value you’re supposed to get from stand-ups. Why, stand-ups were initially a part of Scrum, and other Agile methods, you’ve had this discussion with your teams? Keep standing if you did. If not, please sit down. Thank you. That’s interest..Thank you. 

Now, that’s interesting. It seems that majority of you doing those practices don’t really pay attention to understand how they are working and why they are working. In other words you are risking you are end up doing cargo cult. Most famous example of cargo cult is from Pacific islands. So, during the Second World War American would come, they built military bases. They’d bring airplanes, ships, they’d bring all sorts of cargo like food, weapons, clothes, some of them they shared with the natives. Now, the war is over. Americans were gone, but the natives still wanted all those supplies. So, they figured out that if they copy all the practices the American did, you know, cargo would come. So they build airstrips, air control towers, airplanes, everything out of wood, by the way. And they were hoping, they were hoping, you know that cargo would come. Guess how did it work for them? It didn’t. And if you don’t try to understand the practices you use and just use one example, you’re risking the same fate. 

Now, let’s go back to organizational culture for a bit. If you want to influence how people use different practices you need to work with your beliefs which is basically part of the organizational culture. If you want to change organization culture, what could you do? Organization culture is a sum of behaviors which means that you cannot just mandate a change of organization culture. You can’t say “from today we are a learning organization.” How does it work?  It doesn’t. There is another bad news actually because we cannot mandate the change of behaviors, either. I mean you can introduce a policeman, you can introduce an Agile coach who just keep, do, keep, keep taking care that you are doing the right stuff. And then policeman is gone and what do you do? You go back to the old way of doing things. 

So, how can you influence the culture of change? Well, you can work on the constraints. What kind of constraints? Well, what is allowed? What is not allowed? What is encouraged? What is discouraged? What is rewarded? What is punished? Where are the structures? Where are the hierarchies? And , by the way, when you’re answering those questions where are the rules? And then, what is acceptable? How far I can go breaking the rules before I get burned? Because all your rules are carved in stone, changing influencing the organizational change would be very, very difficult. So, what kind of constraints we can work on? We have values, visions, symbols, for example. Let’s start with those. So, we have values. Every organization, every company has some values. They claim to be, to care about all sorts of good stuff . And those values will frequently end up in stuff in mission statement or visions. 

So, another exercise, another experiment. Please, stand up, everyone who works for a company that has one of those. Most companies do. I know at least one that doesn’t. The one I work for. Cool. Now keep standing, don’t sit down if you can quote the mission statement from the top of your head. 1,2 ,3 that’s all. 4. 5. Thank you. 6. You’re awesome. 

I see a huge problem here. You don’t seem to give a damn about the values of your companies. You cannot even quote all those nice things or those values are written down. But you know what? it doesn’t really matter. We’ll be back on that in a minute. Now, let’s look at some values. This is nice cloud of values that we can use. There are some of those that would be quite common across different the organizations. So, like customer satisfaction, high quality, people. Like let’s pick those 3. Which company wouldn’t claim that they care about customer satisfaction, high quality and people? Well, let’s check. Please stand up everyone that works for a company that claims to care about customer satisfaction, high quality and people. If someone is not standing, well, it may be weird. But what would I know? Ok. Now keep standing, keep standing. Don’t sit down if the leaders and mangers in your organization consistently act every day in a way that shows that they do care about customer satisfaction, high quality and people, consistently act every day. Now, be brave. Cameras are directed here. Except of that one. Ok. Thank you. 

Now, not only you don’t give a damn about the values written down in your mission statements, but a big part of you actually disagrees with claimed values presented by your company. I see a huge problem with authenticity here. Those values that your companies claim to have, no, these are not values. Remember that? Organizational culture, sum of behaviors, not sum of words in a mission statement.  Different thing. So, organizational culture values that are valued by your company would be presented, represented by the behaviors everyday behaviors of the people in that company. Now, you may ask yourself the question “what kind of values are represented by those behaviors?” and I will leave you with that thought. 

Now, another constraint that we can work on and system thinkers would probably disagree with me, are people, I mean organizational culture, sum of behaviors. Behaviors of whom? Of people. Now, when we are talking about people, we hire people. We build our teams. So, when I’m talking about the the culture and people and hiring I cannot but mention hiring for cultural fit. Now, this comes as frequently misunderstood, this comes as frequently misunderstood as “let’s hire people who we get along with.” “Let’s hire people who we feel good when we talk to them.” That’s just a bad idea because we get on well with people who are similar to us. If we hire such people we will end up with a very uniform culture which means our teams won’t be very creative, won’t be very effective in terms of dealing with complex solutions. That’s not exactly something we want to achieve. The way we tackle, we approach hiring   for cultural fit into our logic is we look for some people within some canon, some general cultural canon for a company. But at the same time they are as different from anyone else as possible. So, let me give you an example. 

If you ask me “ Would it very likely that we hire an Indian? Unlikely. I think, I think that in the majority of cases it would be too big cultural difference and having such a person would more a disruption for a culture than augmentation of a culture, at the same time whenever we are talking with candidate we are looking for different characters, different passions, different interests because this is what adds to our culture. At the same time you want them not to disrupt the way we work already. Because we want to avoid group think. 

Group think is psychological phenomenon that basically makes teams or groups of people work to achieve very fast or very quick consensus or to act for conformity. So, if you have that, you get penalty on creativity, you get penalty on effectiveness. So, we don’t want to, you, we don’t want to do that. We want to avoid that. 

Another problem with hiring is that we tend to hire super freaking heroes. I mean we look for individuals who are extremely skilled, extremely intelligent, this is a perfect candidate. Now, the problem is that those guys don’t work alone even if they are introverts. They end up working as a part of a team. Now, we should be paying more attention to how they would help a team become more effective. There’s research around that. The research that says that there is this thing called collective intelligence that it is much more predictive in terms of how team would succeed if accomplishing complex tasks than individual intelligence would be. And we don’t. I’m happy to discuss that late during the event, what makes teams collectively intelligent it’s not individual, it’s not, these are not the traits that we usually pay attention to. And by the way, this research shows that the more women we have in our team, the better the collective intelligence. And it’s not about having a woman in a team, it’s about having as many of them as possible. Again, I’m happy to propose an open place session on that if you want to discuss that in extent. 

Now another constraint that we can work on is leadership. And I’m not taking about leadership as, meaning position of a leader because for that we have another word which is a manger. I’m talking about leadership as the act of leading people. In fact not only the act of leading people but also the opportunity to lead. I mean, if I’m a line worker, a developer, a tester, whoever, do I have opportunities to lead teams, other people? Now, in most companies leadership would be organized in this kind of way. The leadership would be organized in a very structured, very hierarchical manner. Leadership opportunities would be assigned to positions of mangers. So, they would have power to lead. 

Now, let me run one more experiment with you. And you have been standing up and sitting down for quite a while so this will be a thought experiment. So, no physical exercise required. Ask yourself the question “What would happen if in your company now all the hierarchies, all the structures would disappear? Everyone will be peer to everyone else.” Now, obviously your company wouldn’t extinct over night. So, something would happen. Would there be hierarchies? I would say yes. Even if there are no formal structures, some hierarchy, some structures would emerge. Now, what kind of structures would emerge depends on what kind of culture you have in your organization. So if the constraints that form that organizational culture are reasonable, if values and principles are healthy, those structures should be healthy as well. If they are dysfunctional, you may recreate whatever you have right now. So, in other words, the answer to that question that I asked you may give you some kind of insight, what kind of values, what kind of principles your company follows. 

Now, I asked you to do that thought experiment which basically was floating with no management. No matters on this idea that a company doesn’t need managers at all to be run. And there are examples of such companies. In IT industry we do the Valve, the guys that do games or Eachshop, you probably know this one. From other industries, Samco, Morningstar, W.L.Gore, guys that created Goretex. You definitely know what Goretex is. They don’t have mangers at all. It doesn’t mean that they don’t have hierarchies. It means that their hierarchies are emergent. In other words they have to care about the culture, otherwise those organizations will quickly become dysfunctional. Now, this is important because the more you are towards a no management out of scale and this is a scale, by the way. It’s not a binary choice. We either do have mangers or we don’t. It’s a scale between very rigid, very hierarchical structures and no management. You can be anywhere and the closer you are to no management out of scale, the better the distribution of leadership is, the more opportunities for everyone to take over the leadership and do that. And you want to be closer because the closer you are to that scale the more empowered people are. I hate that word, it’s so bloated. It’s like I empower you to bring me a beer, thank you. 

But serves as a proxi here for a, for how much of a change, people have to take over the leadership, how much power they to change the organization that is around them. Whether they can do the right thing when they know what the right thing is. Now, obviously the culture, especially when we are talking about those cultures which are closer to no management is difficult to scale. I mean it’s easy to have no mangers when there’s three of us. It’s not as easy when there are thirty of us. It gets pretty damn hard when there are 300 of us. And I don’t even know how it works for 3000 of us. Now, at the same time, I consider growth as something that is so common but shouldn’t be for pretty much any organization out there, growth scaling up is one of their goals. Should it be? I mean growth is not only a risk for those emergent structures, not only for this no management out of scale, it’s also risk for any culture. Whenever I hear a company say “I want to grow by 100% in a year”, I’m like “Are you sure?” because in a year, if you succeed in a year, you’ll have a very, very different company. A very different culture because if you hire like crazy, which means 100% in a year is hiring like crazy, basically controlling how the culture evolves and where it evolves it’s almost impossible. If you grow slow, you can, you can get people to know the culture, to learn the culture of your company. So, there is not that much risk of changing in the wrong direction. If you hire people like crazy, well, sorry. 

For those of you who are working for big organizations and I know there is a bunch of you here, there is a hope as well. Everything that I said about organizational culture, I was addressing to the culture of the whole company. There is this idea of culture pockets. Culture that can exist within a bigger culture, that may be very different. And these kind of things happen either when a part of company works in isolation, I mean, a branch in a different country, a branch in a different city or a team in a different office, but these things happen also when there is a strong leader that can create for their team they can create a bit different environment. And it may be, this culture pocket can be better, whatever better means in this context. Maybe better than the culture of the whole organization or worse. So, think and ask a boss. He can create, he can create hell for the whole team even though the rest of the organization can be, can be pretty healthy. So, the same is true, all I said is true even in a smaller context. Except culture pockets are not as sustainable as the culture of the whole organization because it’s enough that few people are gone and culture pockets disappears. It’s enough that we have a real organization and the culture pocket disappears. 

Now, what I tried to do with this session. I tried to explain what is organizational culture, why it is important for every company, why understanding the existing culture may help you understand why so many of change initiatives fail. Why some of them are doomed to failure from day one because they are not aligned with what is existing culture of the company. Understanding organizational culture in your context will also help you to become a better leader. 

And last but not least. Understanding your culture around you and understanding what you personally expect from a company may help you to realize that in your current organization you won’t be able to pursue your goals. And it may be good time to move. 

Thank you.
