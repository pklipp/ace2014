# Gitte Klitgaard and Lilian Nijboer: Why Change is So Hard 

![Sketchnote](images/originals/gitte.jpg)

Gitte: Hello. I’ve never been talking to a microphone before so, please tell me if it’s not going through. 

Lilian: Thank you for taking our time to sit here and not outside in the sun. We really appreciate it. If we talk too slow or too soft please let us know, or too hard. First I’d like to introduce ourselves.

Gitte: So, my name is Gitte. I’m an Agile coach and I’m from Denmark. I work with a lot of different companies about how to introduce change and my main topic is ‘’How do we make the world a better place’’ and “How do we help people to have courage at work and in their personal lives?”

Lilian: So, I’m Lilian. You can find me on twitter with double l’s. I’m an Agile coach, as well. I’m from the Netherlands. I love to help people to have more fun in their work, to become more effective, to make happy customers so that day actually are pleased with what I do and they go to their work with pleasure every day. If you want to know more about ourselves, we only have 30 minutes so we’re not going to say anything more just find us around and talk to us. So first we’d like you all, in good tradition of this conference to stand up. I would like you to change something about your appearance, anything.

Gitte: Ok. So, now I would like you to change something about the person to the right of you.

Lilian: If you don’t have anyone to the right of, you just find someone to back of.

Gitte: Ok, thank you, you can sit down now. 

Lilian: Kasia mentioned this morning that she did not have many pictures of cats, as she’s supposed to have so we’re going to make up for that. This is the first one.

Gitte: This is the general reaction of people to change. Why? Why do we need to change? Why do we need to change again? 

Lilian: It’s a natural reaction and it’s ok. Sometimes people think that people who have fear or who have resistance to change are difficult people, people who do not really want a change but often that’s not this case they just need more information. They have problems with the uncertainty, we all have problems with the uncertainty. I don’t like it when my supermarket changes everything around because then I walk in and then I have to think about what I usually do automatically like here’s the milk here’s the bread, now I have to look around. Where is everything? So, that’s one issue and it’s laziness to be honest, we are lazy. Gitte will tell you more about this. And on the other hand, there is uncertainty, about what will happen, what will be the case even if I want to change it myself like, I want to go to the hairdresser, it’s my choice to go to the hairdresser but there’s some discomfort because I don’t know what the outcome is. So it’s natural to have resistance to change. I would like to ask you all “Who’d change back what they change to themselves already?” Wow, pretty good. “Who’d change what someone else changed for them?” That’s pretty good. Usually it’s even harder to have change that stays. Of course, you are a group of people or Agile and you like change, you embrace change so any change will be sustainable really fast. But, to get people to change is the first step, but to keep the change sustainable is the next step. Often people say, I saw it on Twitter a few times, people don’t mind change, but they mind to be changed. I think people actually do mind change even if it’s from the inside, because it offers discomfort. Tom was saying that ‘’people don’t mind the change that they offer themselves’’. I think that’s because they’ve already been through a process, they already have been through a process of changing their perception but not their behavior, yet, because perception is the most difficult thing to change. They’ve already been through the first process.

Gitte: And it also has a lot to do with something we heard yesterday from Liz that “once we change something, we actually change our identity’’. And that makes it really hard for us to change but it also makes it hard for other people to accept changing. So I’ve been through a great change process since I came to Agile community. I used to be terrified of talking in front of my own team and I came ’’Oh, I’ll go to a strange country and talk in front of 100 people, don’t problem’’. And actually my surroundings find it really difficult because my identity changes, so even if we embrace the change ourselves, it is hard enough. Our surroundings also have problems embracing our change.

Lilian: So, we also want to mention, what was mentioned before by other people, changes about people. It’s not about a new structure, it’s not about a new way of working change. It’s about people, and we should take into account their resistance, their fears, their objections. So, we should always take them very seriously because without the people we won’t get anywhere.

First of all, we will want to introduce to you some reasons, why resistance is there, and then from our own experience we will mention some of the stuff that we think could help, help ourselves if we feel resistance to change or help others if we fell they have resistance to change. First one is fear. It’s fear. Automatically when the things change some kind of fear come over us. I want to divide that in two categories, one is self doubt. Can I do this? It’s like when you go to new school, when you went to high school you fell fear because you don’t know ‘’Can I handled this school? Can I do all the stuff they ask from me?’’ So you fell sort of fear to do something which is very natural. 

I once worked for a company that, that had a lot of systems, a lot of old systems, and all of these systems were going be transformed so they only had like 4 or 5 systems left. And one of the older programmers, he was around 60, he had a lot of resistance to this. He didn’t want to do it, it was like 10 years ago, so I was around 29, and I asked him ‘’What are you afraid of?’’, which is really a bad question from a 29 year old to ask a 60 year old, because you check ‘’I’m not afraid of anything, I can do anything’’, but in the and he told me that he wasn’t sure he could learn a new language, and it wasn’t foreign for him because he was still doing assembler and all the new systems would be written in other language, in newer languages. So I ask him ‘’Do you want to try?’’ because it was almost on tension level. So, if he didn’t want to try, we wouldn’t force him. But” Would you like to try?”, and he said ‘’ Yes, I would like to try if I have the chance to opt out if I think, I just can’t do it’’. So, we gave him some security and he got some training and then in the first minutes when someone started doing small things, changing small things he was sitting next to them and just ask questions. Then, he would do small things himself with someone sitting next to him and in the end he could do some small stuff. Before he got turn 64 he didn’t get into really big stuff but he did small changes. The good thing about that was that he was still part of the team. If he didn’t want to do this we would set him a side somewhere and he would have been miserable for the last 4 years of his career. And he was really against me, I hope he wasn’t against me personally but against the change I brought. He saw me as the Persian bringing it, and when I came back 2 years later I walked in and he was like ‘’Oh, are you going to help us again? I’m so happy to see you!’’ So, suddenly he was a big fan, it’s nice to have fans sometimes. 

The other side is uncertainty. And uncertainty can be real, just as self doubt actually. Uncertainty is more about “What will this mean?”, “What will this change mean to me?”, “Will I lose my job?”, “Will I lose a certain position I got within this organization?”. In one organization where you are there was uncertainty but there was one certainty: no one will lose their job. It was really important to get that uncertainty out of the way so people will get a bit more relaxed. There was another certainty, though. They had to apply for a new job so they would be placed into a new position. And actually the uncertainty of not knowing if that would happen was worse than the certainty that knowing it will happen even though it was not good news for them. They really saw this as a bad thing. It’s like when you’re waiting for a train and it’s late, you don’t like that it’s delayed but it’s easier if you know why it is delayed. If somewhere there is a sign that’s says there was an accident and it will be like 10 minutes later. So uncertainty is worse than hearing something that’s not fun.

Gitte: So, the other part and some of the things that does is that our brain is really, really, really lazy. So, we kind of have two ways of thinking basically, I’m not going to go into a lot of neurosurgery but one part of the brain is the one who does things automatically or almost automatically, and that is where our brain likes to be because it doesn’t use a lot of energy. So, there are o lot of the stuff that we do, that we don’t think about. So, if I have to stand here and think about “Ok. So, how do I actually move my legs?” So, I need to lift it and moved it over here at the same time as I’m talking and the same time that I’m holding something then I would be in problem. So, the brain has this mechanism of making things automatic, so it doesn’t use a lot of energy on it. And every time we are exposed to change and every time we need to learn new stuff out brain needs to work harder which means that the natural reaction of a brain is to say ‘’ Can I just do what I’m used to? It’s just nicer and more comfortable and it’s easy.’’ So basically our brain is also very lazy. So, when we do all these changes we need to learn new stuff and it will take up a lot of energy and if we are not careful we will use all our energy. So that’s also one of the reason is that our brain is so lazy. And there’s a good reason for that because we need as much energy as possible to survive. And it’s the same thing that makes us scared. And there is a reason to have all these fears because it is to help us survive.

Some people talk about not being afraid, but once you are afraid is your brain telling you something, and of course we have this initial reactions like if we see a big animal we other supposed to kill it or run away, at least try to kill it. And that’s how our brain reacts. But there is a reason for this, there’s actually a reason. There’s a dangerous animal next to me. So, when we feel the fear we also want to look into and see why am I actually afraid of this. And is it because is just my brain being lazy and not wanting to learn something new or is it something behind it?

Lilian: Another reason can be cognitive dissonance. It’s already been mention by Marcin yesterday. He called it cognitive bias is actually that our brain has tendency if we get information that doesn’t agree with our believes and our thoughts that causes discomfort. You can see it with people who smoke. If they see another research that says that smoking will make sure that you die younger or you get lung cancer or any other disease, people tend to say ‘’Yeah my brother in law did this all the time. And our grandfather he smoked and he became 96 before he died.” So we try to get different information to make, to justify what our behavior and our believes are at that time. There was research done in the 50’s with a cult that believed that the world was going to end. And we’ve seen these cults before. They have a certain date and everybody, the entire cult was sure that the world was going to end. The date that they set the world was going to end, the world didn’t end because we are still here. And the researchers thought that then because they had contrary evidence, that they will say ‘’ Ok, we were wrong. Apparently, the world didn’t end.’’ But that didn’t happen, they find new information to justify what they did and they got the date wrong. And there are two ways to cover cognitive dissonance. One thing is to get information or justify what you are doing to get it into the right direction, the other one is to try and change your believes. This is the more difficult one, as we said we are lazy, but that’s the one you really want to achieve. You could also see that was a research done, with people who had to do a really tedious job. At the end, one of the group, half of the group is given a dollar and they were saying ‘’Ok, here you have a dollar. Would you please tell the people after you, that is was really great job?’’ And the other group, they get 20 dollars and they said ‘’ ok, would you please tell the group next to you that it was a really awesome job?” And then, after that they asked the people separately ‘’Did you really find it a nice job?”. People who got a dollar actually changed their perception because the dollar wasn’t enough for them, to justify what they were saying. 20 dollars apparently it was enough for us to justify to lie, so we don’t change our believes. One dollar wasn’t enough so we had to change our believes. So, it’s really important if we get new information that we give it in a way that people can use it to change the way they believe at a moment.

Gitte: Yeah, and one of the problems that we also have is a lot of our culture is about having a zero fault culture. And there’s a lot of blaming. So, basically also sometimes when we tease Agile we say ‘’Ok. So, you go into the sprint and you commit to this sprint goal and you say that you will do this within the sprint and once we fail someone will go say ‘’Hey, you promised me that you would deliver this in a sprint’’. And what I’ve seen in Denmark also is that during all this crisis this has just became more and more apparent in all the companies because all of a sudden they start firing people like in banking in Denmark. Banking has always been like if you had a job in banking you’re good for life. You leave a bank if you choose to but there’s no firing. And during this crisis we actually started having people getting fired, which meant that people were afraid of making mistakes. And we tend to have this, we tend to have this. We want to have this zero fault culture. We want to have the zero box software and we want to be perfect and we also do it as people not only in software. We do it as people, we want to be perfect people.

And there’s always this about not having faults. And that also means that if I try something and it doesn’t work, I fail. So what we need to do is to find something where it’s ok to fail, where it’s ok to make an experiment. And you can start up small. You can do something really small like, I tried to make the coffee yesterday and it was really, really bad in our apartment. That’s really small. And I could be easily like “Ok, I’m the first one up and I need to make coffee for the other one so I have a responsibility.” So, I could have panicked about that, and some people will do, even if it’s a small thing that you’ve never tried before, but tried it out. So we need….

Lilian: everyone run because the coffee was awful.

Gitte: …yeah the coffee was awful. So, the coffee was really, really awful. Sorry, sorry. Today I had Zuzi instead and she made good coffee. So, but I tried it out and that’s ok, and nobody said ‘’You made really bad coffee!’’, except for now, but that’s Lilian. So that’s also something that you can do to have changes is to have build a culture where it’s ok to fail.

Lilian: Another one, this is from Carter. Well, he mentions it a lot, no sense of urgency. If people don’t know what they should change, why should do change, because they are told so. When people change because they are told so, that will became false sense of urgency. People will run around and they will make all kinds of, of, they will do a lot of work but they don’t know what they are really working on, what is the sense of urgency. The sense of urgency should be a positive thing, it should not be a negative thing. If you go to your organization and you say ‘’ Oh, my god, is really going wrong we make a shitty product. All our competitors are doing a way better job and if we go on like this we will all lose our jobs, we will get fear and fear paralyses. So, your sense of urgency should be your friend not your enemy, so what you should do is you should think of, look around what are our opportunities how can we became better, how we can became better than our competitors, look at it in a positive way. It’s like I’m an Agile coach, if I would think like ‘’Oh, my God, Gitte is so much better’’ and I can never became as good as she can. Then I would paralyze. I would stand still. What I should be thinking is ‘’Oh, my God, Gitte learned this and this and I think it really helps her. Maybe I should do that as well.” And I look at my clients what do they need, how can I help them even better. That is what motivates people. If there is no sense of urgency it’s often easy to see. There are a lot of meetings if there is no real sense of urgency with no outcomes. If you ask someone like ‘’Really, this is important?’’ and he answer ‘’ Yes, it’s is really important. We should, I was make a meeting for next week’’, that’s like saying to your 5-year old when he said he needs to go to the bathroom ‘’Ok. We need to go to 2 more stores that we’ll go home and you can go to pee.” Then, apparently you don’t see the sense of urgency. So, the sense of urgency is really important, and it’s also important to do it in a way that people on the business floor actually understand it. I’ve seen it happen a lot of time that a CEO would mention what the sense of urgency is in the bad way, like ‘’We are going down. There are no sales anymore.” And they do it with figures that people don’t understand. So, they like walk away and they think like “Ok. Apparently there is a sense of urgency but we do not really know where it comes from.” So it’s also important that the sense of urgency it’s clear.

Gitte: And it can also be the feeling of loss. So can be the feeling of loss that if you change something you will lose what you already have. And it can be all kinds of things. It can be your identity. So, if you are the top programmer in the group and everyone comes to you and now you say “Ok. We are going to do Agile. We are going to work in a team and we are going to have that everyone works together and nobody is going to be the top developer”, then you lose your identity. So there’s a lot of places where you can have this feeling of loss. And again a lot of this because we like to do things automatically. So, once we cannot do this anymore we get a feeling of loss. And we have a contrast.

Lilian: Actually there was some research on the feeling of loss and it has the same stages of mourning. At first there is like denial like ‘’It’s not going to happen, it doesn’t have anything to do with me’’, and then there it comes the guilt and angry like ‘’What I’ve been doing wrong all this time? Wasn’t it right what I did?’’ and I don’t want to change it’s been right the way it was and in the end if you are lucky you get acceptance and moving on. So, did it. 

We are not saying that this list is extended, there were more reasons why people can have resistance to change. What we like to do now is from our own experience, tell you what we think could do to help people who experience resistance to change, or yourself if you experience it.

First thing is take fears and abjections seriously. Like we mention, we are talking about people so even if you think it’s not rational for, to them it is important, to them it is rational. So, take it seriously it’s the first step. Involve everybody, and involve everybody does not mean that you have one meeting in which you tell this is our plan, this is what we thought of and this is what you are going to do. Involve everything means from the beginning, because it is what Tom said ‘’ If the idea comes from the people themselves, the resistance to change will be much less’’. In the general people themselves know very well what has to happen, even better then management, who sits somewhere above everybody. So, involve everybody is also means that you cannot just have a meeting and say ‘’Ok. So, we have to change. Go ahead, do it!’’ You have to give some guidance, you have to say like ‘’Ok. I think maybe we together we can see some areas in which we need to change and we can form some groups.’’ And in the beginning you will guide them and then you say ‘’Ok. You can take over from here.’’ There needs to be some guidance. You cannot expect from people what are being doing what they are tell to do for a long time, to suddenly do it themselves, to suddenly became self organized and know what to do.

Give information; it’s the most important thing. Communicate, communicate, communicate. If you can’t communicate anything, communicate that you cannot communicate anything. Just always keep saying what’s happening, what’s the progress, what does it mean for you. And also means that you have to give the information in a certain way. When people were told that they were getting, they were not getting fired, but they did get a different job, we sent out letters to the people who were getting, who did have to apply. We did this, we thought it through very well, we thought, we did this on a fri…, we first sent out an e-mail that today people will get the news if they would have to apply for a new job or not. Then on Friday when they got home they got the letter. So, they had the entire week-end to think about it and on Monday we had a meeting with all these people. The people felt horrible, they felt like they were put aside, like they were fired. I learned from that like we should have done it in person.  There was a reason why we did not do it in person because we were afraid that if we’re going to say to someone it will say all the project managers are going to be laid off and need a new job. But still we handle with people and we don’t want to have people feel like this. The way you communicate it’s very important, the way you give information.

Provide education and guidance, this is the fourth of self-doubt. This is actually kind of easy to help with. You can give people education, you can give them guidance, it’s much better, easier then uncertainty, because uncertainty will be there. We will keep changing so there will be uncertainty because we want to continue this improvement. We want kaizen which means we will be changing. So don’t try to comfort people in uncertainty, try to teach them to handle uncertainty.

And the last one, be open and realistic. If you do know there will be people laid off, if you do know some things will happen, that will not be good news. Do mention it, do it in a specific way like I mentioned, don’t just throw out an e-mail. But it doesn’t help if you keep it to yourself. In general just someone will hear it, there will be gossip which will be much worse because we do not like uncertainty. We prefer the certainty. 

Gitte: So, an important thing that is also when we go into change, is that, as I mentioned before, we like to be in a comfort zone. That’s where we do things automatically. And when we go into change, we need to move outside of this because if we don’t go outside of this we will not move out of the automatic system. But the important thing is to move out only into the learning zone. Well, things are a little bit dangerous. But, it’s ok. And then you can go back. An important thing about actually moving a little bit, learning something and then going back to your comfort zone is that makes your comfort zone grow. And sometimes, it won’t. Sometimes you’ll go out, you’ll try something and you’ll say ‘’Fuck, I’m never going to do this again. It’s so horrible, I might do it again but it’s still not me.”  But, if you don’t go back, what happens is that you’ll keep moving out here. You’ll move out into the danger zone which also means that when we go and change organizations if we just keep moving, keep moving, people will move out into the danger zones and they will get stressed, they will be demotivated, they will be really scared. So, when you do changes, and this also counts for yourself. 

So, as I said before, I was terrified of speaking, I mean 7 years ago I got a call from my manager. You need to be able to say something in a room with your team. And I’m talking about my team I was working every day if we had a meeting I could not speak. So, what I did was I went out into schools and talk to girls about what’s it like to be a computer scientist as a woman. Because I knew that, I was a woman, I am a computer scientist. How does this work? And I went out into schools because that was really safe. There were little girls there just listening to me. They would be around 10, 12 years old. So, that was kind of safe. Then I started moving into education fares, big fares where people would come and listen to what is computer science and I would talk about it there. And I kept moving back into my comfort zone and kind of-sigh-, relaxing and figuring out what went well. So, that was kind of my way of starting this change. And as I found out I had all these more successes and it was ok. And nobody is actually going to kill me if I say something wrong on the stage. I became more and more confident and I kept moving so now my comfort zone of speaking in public is really, really huge. If somebody asked me ‘’Could you go tomorrow and talk about retrospectives at a conference with 2000 people?’’ I would say ‘’Yeah. No problem.’’ Even though I don’t have a presentation ready. So, that’s when I got it. But it doesn’t have to, it is not always that you can actually grow this. A way of growing this is taking all these baby steps.

Lillian: You can actually compare this. Yesterday we talked about flow. If people are too long in a comfort zone, they will get bored. If they are too long in a danger zone, they will get burnt out. So, we have to try to keep them in the yellow zone. They have to try to keep themselves in the yellow zone. There’s actually also have a deep psychology if people have a fear of going outside. First you take a little step, you go out to the front door and you go back. If that feels comfortable you go to the grocery store on the corner. This is actually used for other fears as well, also for arachnophobia, but I’m not going to try it. 

Gitte: So, what can we do? So, one thing that we can do is create a no blame culture. So, the prime directive for the retrospective is ‘’We truly believe that anyone did the best they could do with the resources at hand.’’ So, if we grade this non blame culture, and something goes wrong, we take it, this is something we can learn from. So, creating a culture where it’s ok to fail, where it’s safe to fail, and make small experiments so that it is actually safe to fail, and sometimes we will fail big. But if we have a culture that’s zero fault culture we will not make experiments because we know we will be punished if we fail. So, if we can make a culture where’s ok to fail and not be blamed, then it will help a lot with change. Another really important thing Lilian also said ‘’Take people’s fears seriously.’’ Because you can go into an organization, into a team or whatever and say ‘’That’s just stupid. There’s nothing to be afraid of.’’ That’s not going to help anyone. So, take people seriously and listen to them, actively listen to them. Don’t listen to be able to respond, but listen to them so that you know what makes them afraid or resistant to this change. And you might even learn from it because they might have a valid point. And give them time, it takes time. You’re not just going to be ‘’Oh, we’ll take it to a 2-day grandmaster class so now we will be self-organized. Go do!’’ It takes time and it takes time to build these things in. 

Lilian: So, this is me.

Gitte: In my former job I worked for IBM. This is me being an IBM consultant at a client. So, I’m in India, at least I try to be so I do the crane. And this is what I’m doing here. So, this is my new apprentice. And this is one of the tools that I personally use when I go out to a client because of the fact that I’m not afraid to be a little bit silly makes people comfortable. Because what they expect a lot of times when they hear an IBM consultant coming out, first of all they expect a man, in a suit, really stiff, talking about serious stuff. And then they get me. What makes them relax because I’m not as scary. I know I haven’t advanced in IT because I’m a woman. I saw a lot of men don’t see me as competition which makes it a lot easier to come in and help them. But also the fact that I’m not afraid to do silly stuff. I’m not afraid to have fun. I’m not afraid to be who I am. It’s part of what helps people realize that it’s ok to do stuff. And also when I do mistakes, if I do have a training and I do a mistake, we’ll see it. This is a really good example. I just said this wrong and I’m going to learn from it and that’s what really you need to build into your culture. So, using myself as role model to help people. So, I’m kind of crazy enough to apply this to myself. 

So, yes, that’s a real tattoo. An d I am terrified of needles. So, I got this tattoo because to me this being brave enough to be myself and to embrace change is so important to me. So, one thing that you can do is also have a little courage and courage does not mean to remove all fears because as I said before fear are really, really important to us. Because they teach us something, it is stupid to go to somebody and ask ‘’Would you, please, stick me in my arm with a needle?’’ that’s stupid. So, there’s a reason I’m afraid of needles. Put some ink in my arm because my blood will really like that. There’s something wrong about that. So, the fears are ok. So, you think I’m talking too much?

Lilian: Our time is almost

Gitte: Oh, damn it. Ok. So, I’m talking too much so I’m giving the word to Lilian.

Lilian: Thank you. I thought you were done. Another thing is that if you feel you have resistance, if you feel that you are scared find other people. Talk to them, see how you can help them. It was Liz talked about yesterday. Make friends, make friends in other teams. See how you can help each other. Ask for help, don’t be afraid to ask for help. It’s not a weakness, it’s a strength. Try to create networks. Try to connect to people. It’s really important one.

Gitte: Yeah. So, ask for help if it’s yourself. Ask for help. Take small steps. And listen to your fears and figure out if there’s something real behind that. It might just be that you are afraid because of the change but there might be some reasons behind it. 

Lilian: So, the wrap-up is ‘’Give people the power that do guide them. Aim for the heart, don’t aim for the head. And don’t booo over resistance. It will only cause more resistance and you will fail. And again we are dealing with people. And people respect, they deserve respect. 

Gitte: So, if you have any questions, please, come talk to us. We will be here the rest of the day. Thank you very much.
