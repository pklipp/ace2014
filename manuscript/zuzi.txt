# Zuzi Sochowa:  Mastering Retrospectives

![Sketchnote](images/originals/zuzi.jpg)

Zuzi: So, good morning! 

Audience:  Good morning!

Zuzi: Ahhh, good morning! Can you please stand up? I really loved this practice yesterday so I would like to try it. So, how many of you think the retrospective is just awesome? You can sit down. How many of you think it’s just a good practice? So, sit down.  And the rest? You’re still staying. Do you think it’s horrible? 

Audience: Booo!

Zuzi: Boo. Ok. Well, retrospective is an awesome practice, at least for me and I will try to explain why. What’s wrong with that? Well, they’re going with other the slides. I can still see them here. So, if you have good eyes, I can show you my slides here. The thing about the retrospective is that, if you have good eyes, there is a round table and. Ah, it’s here. And my first experience with the retrospective was in US about ten years ago and I didn’t like that practice much. I’ve been sitting at a table like that with my colleagues and we’ve talking about the same things which we like, loud, and which they would like to improve. So, I’m a bit introvert. So, I don’t like to speak public about my feelings which they forced me. And these American colleagues, they’ve been kind of afraid to speak about their feelings because their manager was sitting there. So, it was not really a nice thing, but look at it, it got such a nice animal like that and this nice friend, understands what you are talking about.  So, we passed this round and round and can talk to this animal and say “Ok. I like the last sprint this and I think they should improve that” and he understands. So, it makes it a little bit better. It is the real master of retrospective, by the way. Look at it. 

So, it was not really anything good. And it happened to me that I am one of the very first sprints, we did the retrospective and my colleague from Prague came together to the US with me and we’ve been sitting together at the retrospective there listening some boring stories about really how to reply to those questions and say nothing. And then about the third person was my colleague and he just tell “Well, you know, I think it’s good that we finally have a let and we can work together because previously we’ve been sitting in these cubicles and don’t interact at all. So, that’s what I like and what I would to keep.”  And then he said “Well, but there is something which I don’t like much and I don’t understand maybe. And one of them is the point estimation.“ He just didn’t have a clue how to use and I think we should more cooperate so how about to try to pair programming. The habit to do this, this and that because I don’t like that behavior.  He was the first person who just speak up and say what he really feel.  And that’s something very surprising happened . The rest of our colleagues were kind of afraid and ok. Nothing happened really. So, let’s join him and let’s tell what we really don’t like. So, from that time it changed a little bit and after some time we start like retrospective. We start using it and then I came back to Prague and teach my Prague colleagues how to do the retrospective  and what to do with it. 

Sometime later I just realized that, that it’s about looking into the mirror. At that time they call it reflection meeting, anyway.  And if you try to look into the mirror to yourself, you’ll most likely see a bit different picture than you have in your head. In your head you are awesome. And in the mirror you sometimes see that your hair isn’t good enough or maybe you have some problems with your dress or whatever. So, it’s a good practice to look into the mirror and move the mirror to your team and say ok, how I see all my different colleagues and what’s really inside those people. So, looking into the mirror. Sometimes you have a different idea about yourself and your colleagues and it’s rather this. And there is no single truth. It’s just about the feelings, it’s just about reflection. But that’s kind of thing.

Then, later on, I found out that there is a good framework which is good to follow during the right retrospective and it’s about the facilitation. So everything you facilitate, the first step is to do a small introduction to explain the people you’re facilitate “Ok. This is a retrospective. We do this, this and that and at the end there would be an outcome. “So, that’s very important. It brings some kind of certainty to all the people who are listening to you, who came to the retrospective and, you know, might not feel comfortable, and so on.

And if you happen to be doing the retrospective over the phone with your colleague in India or America, or wherever else, there is one activity which you should do. The very first moment when the retrospective starts after you explain the format, you just to the weather check. A kind of a checking. I’m in. the retrospective has started. And the weather check is about that every one of you will just say if you were a weather, which kind of weather you would be. And one of you would say “I’m a sunshine.” And the other one would say “Well, I’m a thunderstorm.” And the other one would say “I’m a mid cloudy weather. “ And another one would say “I’m the morning fog.” The main thing is that everyone will speak up at the very beginning of the retrospective and they will just mentally forget on all those things they’ve brought, the retrospective. They are just in from that moment on. And the other thing good is that you pretty much understand that that person doesn’t have a good day, so you might be a bit careful speaking with him.  It doesn’t say if it’s personal or from work. So, it doesn’t really offend you. It’s just easy to say “I’m a thunderstorm today.” You should be a little bit careful. But it’s a good thing.

Second step. After the introduction which was really short honest stuff, nothing really important, general ideas, and at the beginning I was quite happy with this round table stuff, sending this round token thing and listening to each other. I think I’m quite good at moderating events so it worked for me. However, sometimes I’ve got the problem is some other teams that it was hard to follow and it was kind of awkward for people to speak happens and so on. 

And once I’ve got a team which says “Well, we are best team in the company. We don’t have any problems. We don’t need to do any retrospective” I say “Well, ok. Well, you are a perfect team, you can be really such awesome” of course we have some tiny problems that, you know, they solved them right away. So there is no need to stop and do the retrospective.  So, I was like thinking what to do as a team and this is a framework which helped me a lot. So, they draw on a big flipchart the chart and I ask the people whenever something happen which you feel is interesting just try to stick it and put it on top of that flipchart. So, as the days go just create such a chart. So, you all see what’s going on and we can talk about it at the end of the sprint, which we did. At the end of the sprint I add to these two smiley faces. There are not smiley faces here and asked the people to vote how do you feel when that thing happen. Are you happy or not really? And I found out that it’s really strange because you would assume that if someone feels good, the others would feel good about it as well. But we found out it wasn’t the case. So, they have some things to discuss and this board contain a lot of funny stuff like Petrus play the same song over and over again even if you don’t like it. And then another card says “Well,  …the song, which is cool. We love it.” So what I did I just put those stickers and give it to the people and do some small contest like “whoever gets the most stickers wins”. There was no real prize, it was fun.  And finally that team start to like retrospective. So that was kind of a good. 

And then, the time goes and I’ve been empowered of some Agile transformation group in some bank and that Belgium guy who drives it, he said, you know, we are running Scrum over this Agile transformation group. So we are doing stand-ups, we are having back walk, we are doing some groomings and we are doing retrospectives. And I said “Yeah, yeah, I know the retrospective. I’m quite curios which kind of animal they are going to have.” But there was no animal, there was no round token or anything.

They just used this kind of star and what he said, he said “Well, you know, write a sticker and put it on one of these segments.” So, if you want to start with, if you want to do that part of thing a little bit less, a little bit more of if you want to stop it or if you just want to continue with that, and please use a pen, the marker pen , I mean, so we can all read it.  And make it one or  two words so it’s easy to read for all of us. So, we did and at the end of that activity I was like thinking “That’s really cool. It’s kind of a checking activity as well.” At the very beginning you ask people to do something so they write a sticker, then you ask them “Can you please stand up?” and once you’re down, go to the board, stick it here and read it aloud which is kind of a good. So, everyone of you has to stand up, do something, go there, read it. But it was kind of less personal and less difficult for people to do so. So, I tried the next day and it was kind of a good. The team of my other client they like it. And from that time I’ve been using this framework. But, sometimes you find out it’s still boring and it’s still not enough. So, I’ve been thinking. Ok. Let’s use this because sometimes the testing problem, for example, repeats all over again and again and again so we need some specific retrospective to talk just about testing. And you can still draw the start, stop, continue, less and more thing all over it.  But focus on the testing, which helps. 

But, it’s still not enough. Sometimes a team were saying “Well, we are bored with the retrospective.” And it was good at the beginning. It’s cool. We like it. But, you know, after some time it’s all the time the same thing surround. We are not solving big problems anymore. So, I’ve been thinking  how to make it change and different and how to involve a team. And the thing is creativity. So, one of the concepts which you can read over the internet is to draw a boat.  And still to do stickers which involve the team but you can identify the thing that stops you. Put it into the anchors. The more deep, the more stopping. And you can identify the winds which just helps you to move forward. Again if you make it very far, over there, it means it’s a very strong winds, so it helps you a lot. So, it’s a concept which brings creativity into the team and which helps you to look at things from different perspectives again. And I was afraid to use it at the beginning, but then I found out it’s quite a good thing, but it doesn’t stop here. It’s about the creativity, so if you just use the boat over and over again, it will not work. 

So, the thing is the next time I said “Well, let’s do it differently this time and let’s identify the things what makes me smile during the last sprint and put the cards here in the middle of the smiling face. Because I really would like to know what makes you happy. And then another thing is what makes you unhappy, what would you like to improve or change or don’t like put it outside of that smiling face. So what I’m saying doesn’t even have to be complementary. We don’t care about start, stop, continue, less and more. We don’t care about what we like and want to continue with or want to improve. It could be what makes me smile. That is one category and the other one, well, let’s talk about some changes. 

So, once I’ve been preparing this presentation I’ve been like thinking “Let’s ask my clients if they have some pictures from their retrospectives.” And I have got these three pictures which I would like to share with you. So, this one is kind of usual, you would say, but still has those two faces, there and there. And it’s good and bad. But these 2 faces are kind of, you know, they’ve been playing and they enjoyed during the retrospective. You see, it has some personality. So, if you draw it, even if you do it this way, you just bring some energy into the team and help you to have more fun. So, that’s first picture.

The second one is the boat which I just draw. But, you see it’s not just the boat, there is a captain over there, there are some things here. They try to make it personal and funny. But then I have this picture. This grandmaster she sent it to me and said “Well, it was drawn by a whole team.” So what I just said when I came to the retrospective I said “Let’s draw a sports car. A Ferrari.” So here is the sign of Ferrari. I don’t know if you see it, if you recognize it. That’s real Ferrari. And you can see that one wheel is blue, second one is red so it was really drawn by different team members. So, they all came into that place and draw that car and she said at some point of a time one of our producers said “you know, we should  draw a parachute which will prevent  us from moving fast.”  And then at the end someone draw the wall. Once we hit it, we are dead. And what I like on that concept is that I never really tell them “Well, you should be creative and involve the whole team in drawing a picture in retrospective.” It’s means just talking about some basic retrospectives and they invented it by themselves. And they’re becoming fun, they enjoyed that. And there’s a team which is really healthy because they can having fun during the retrospective. They are self-organized to create even the content of that retrospective, the format. 

So, let’s go back to that thing. Part of the second stage of creating ideas. Sometimes it’s happened to you that you have so many ideas from the team that it’s very hard to make it kind of clear what we are going to talk about. So, I always invited the team next to board and say “Well, look at those cards and think about how to group them, how to make them one single group with label so we can talk about the testing, we can talk about the review, we can talk about the product owner.” And then another step is again all team next to the board and say “Well, do the dot table thing.” So all of you have 3 votes or 5 votes, depending on your choice and you select which idea is the most important for you. Again it’s a team who decides so. It’s not a Scrum master anymore, it’s a team who’s deciding. And that’s kind of a good thing.  But he whole retrospective and the whole facilitation stuff on that  meeting is about extending the scope. So at the beginning we just knew we were doing the retrospective to learn something which should improve our processes. And then they extend the scope and they have 5 ideas. And then out of those 5 ideas we generated options had to address those areas as to how to improve them. So, after all, in this picture we have 16 options. So, they really extended the scope. And of course we have the most options from the idea which has the highest number, the highest number of the votes. So, it’s the most important for the team. So, we spent more time on that one. 

What I realized that sometimes it’s easy to generate the symptoms. It’s very hard to identify the root cause. So one of the favorites I like because it’s nice fish bone stuff draw is not only ask what’s wrong, what should be improved, what we are going to do about that but is ask where is that happening and who’s responsible for that, and why is that happening and when. All those questions will just help you identify real options, what you are able to do with that. You’re not still selecting what exactly will do the next sprint, you’re just generating the options so you are just expanding the space. So, the most common question is “what else?”. Another format which you all knew because it was last ACE! T-shirt is 5 why’s. So, ask why 5 times in a row and understand the root cause. I don’t have to explain that, I guess. 

So, the next step once you understand the root cause it’s about the action items. And the previous steps were important, was good but you often hear teams which are saying “Well, in our retrospective we talked about it. We complained a bit how hard our life is”, but there would be no action item in the end. It’s just you know, have a nice talk, nice conversation. But that’s not enough. The goal of a retrospective is to create concrete action items which are assigned to concrete people teams members and they are able to finish those action items within the next sprint. You don’t have to solve the huge area about non functional product owner for example, but you should address it. 

And there is one thing which is kind of team health meter. It just says how good your team is. And you can count it. So, how many of your action items is going into the team. If it’s half-half you are not healthy enough. If it’s like 95%, that’s what you want to achieve. You want to have all your action items coming to the team. So you may want to say “We, as a team want to have a different product owner.” Well, if you just say “Someone should change the product owner on the role.” Nothing will happen usually. So, what you may want to agree on is: I will go to the product owner and explain him how to change the behavior. That’s actually an item which is going into the team. And that’s what health a team are doing taking is are taking the responsibility. And we can change.

And there is another thing which kind of say if you are healthy team or not. There are lots of studies that successful teams despite if they are Agile or not, they are having 4 positive things for every one negative. 4 positive to one negative. So, you kind of have to help the positivity to grow and make it visual. So, one of the things is to do the positivity wall and if you like something, just put a sticker in, write it here or on the flipchart. We have no bugs, we have good sprint results. We just have fun or went for beer on Friday which was cool. I’ve been on holiday. If you see it, it just increase the rate of success of the whole team. So make it visual. 

And finally, we’ve been talking about starting and it’s time to do the closing. So, it’s integral part of your retrospective. At the end you should say “Well, there’s the action items which we all decided to take into account and we will deliver them during the next sprint. Very fast. What a very important. And that was all about functional teams which are willing to speak. They might be afraid, so, they might need a friend, Winston, but they are talking at least. 

But sometimes you have teams which are not talking at all. They are afraid or they don’t trust each other. They don’t trust their manager. They have personal problems with some other colleague. They got fights in the past. So, those teams are not willing to say anything in a retrospective. So what so you do? Just draw such a nice picture, stick it on the doors to the retrospective meeting and as a team to put a sticker at the personality they feel to be. 

So, first of them, over there is a explorer. There’s a person who’s really active. You want to have all team members as explorers. Of course, that’s the ultimate goal. They are going to the retrospective with high energy, they are speaking loud. They are saying “wow, that’s cool. We will do this and what about if we do that.” 

Then we have a shopper. Is the person who is going to the retrospective with this cart thing, shopping cart, and think like “Retrospective, yeah. Sometimes I learn something but in general I don’t expect much.” They are more quiet, they are quite easy to involve. So, if you have high energy you can involve them and they just forget they came with these low expectations.  

And then you have that nice person and that person is saying “Well, it’s better to be at the retrospective than at my work office because I can have a rest, I can just, you know, sleep mentally. It’s easy. I don’t expect anything and I’m not going to be involved, I’m just having a rest. I’m on vacation” it’s still not too bad. You can still get that involved, on board. But then, there is the last picture. 

It’s a prisoner. So, that’s the people who are saying “I’m here at the retrospective because my manger said I have to go to the retrospective. I don’t like to be here. I don’t want to be here. I just hate it, all those meetings. And I don’t want to speak up because I don’t trust the other team members, for example.” And if you happen to have the team full of prisoners, it’s better to stop and say “Well, I’m not doing the retrospective anymore. Let’s talk about us as a team and what I usually use for that teams which have personal problems and prisoners there, I just talk “If I were you I would not like to be working in your team.” Let’s talk about what makes us team good. Let’s talk about the values. So, what do you think it’s a good team? And I say something after some time. And what makes you flourish? What makes you awesome team? You personally, here. And then we talk about what makes things difficult. So what are we going to do if there is something which is going wrong and then accountability? What do we really do to actionate them? And there’s kind of a fair retrospective of designed  partnership  on ends, on how we are going to work together and be together. And then the next time, it’s chill to remind a bit if they are able to do the regular retrospective. 

So, to summarize it, it’s about the change. I used retrospective format to make from individuals a team which is cooperating, sharing and having fun. And , the last thing. Well, do you know that grog is very smart animal, right? It can say no, accidentally. If you ask the frog to jump into the boiling water, it will say “No, no , no, I’m not going to boil myself up.” That you accidentally happen that the frog is sitting in a pot, which is cold and you start heating below it, it will never notice. 

And now, please, stand up again. So many of you happen to be sitting in boiling water without even realizing it? You can sit down. Well, I did. I’ve been working for a company and I didn’t like that job anymore but I was just thinking I like that company because ten years ago it was a great company. And I’ve still been working there. I should have jump off and quit. And the retrospective helps me to jump off, you can sit down, to jump off the pot fast so I’m not boiled up. So, think about that frog and do the personal retrospective often because that’s the most important thing. It can help him but it can help you as well otherwise you will be boiled as the frog because you haven’t even notice you should change. Ok?

That’s me by the way. You can recognize the colorful hair. Thank you very much and enjoy the rest of the conference.
