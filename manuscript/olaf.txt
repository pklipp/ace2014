# Olaf Lewitz: Reduce politics and improve culture

![Sketchnote](images/originals/olaf.jpg)

Olaf Lewitz:  I hope you are well fed and watered. I want to welcome you with my whole heart. When I entered school I was very open-hearted and open-minded and learned very quickly that that’s not helpful for being successful. 

About 15 years later when I entered the workplace, I tried again to be very open-hearted and open-minded and again that didn’t work out so well. Over the past 20 years in the workplace I managed to regain being open-minded, open-hearted and actually talk about love in the workplace without being embarrassed. I want to share with you how that came about and what I learned on the way because one of the main things is that we all have a very individual idea of what’s normal and we all share a very big fear to actually show our normal to the other “normal” persons out there.

So what I thought, I got this message, not in exactly these words because I grew up in Germany, as a child that you deserve to love what you do and that you are loved and experience that love for what you do. And society, school and work tried to beat that out of me. Thank God not very successfully over time and it let me to, as Paul already said, label myself as a trust artist because I want to help others unleash this wholeheartedness because I think our society, our workplaces and our organizations are lacking it and we’re losing a lot of human potential and creating a lot of pain that way.

What does wholeheartedness means in terms of an organization? I’m talking about workplaces where we love to belong. A friend of mine in Brazil  has a company slogan “I’ll make you love Mondays” and that’s exactly what I mean, that we have a workplace that doesn’t feel so different from the rest of our life, that doesn’t feel so alien, that doesn’t feel like we need to bend ourselves to be successful, but a place where we can show up, feel we are acknowledged, valued as we are, authentically, and where we allow others to do the same, to feel the same, to experience the same.

I wonder if Russ likes this one. It was created by 3 people at the Play4Agile conference this year. We were talking about the manifesto and what’s important and we came up with the idea that what's really important are only the first 3 words: We value people. Period. Thank you. Everything we do that doesn’t add value to the people and helps the people to add value is probably not helping in the bigger picture. 

There’s a lot of conversations going on about systems, how to change systems, how systems evolve, how people play a role in the system and in all my years as a developer, as a manager, as a pupil, as a teenage scout leader, as a coach, consultant, whatever, I’ve learned that most of us continually underestimate our ability to change a system. My parents gave me a good example of how to treat work in your life. They basically accepted everything they experienced during the day and complained about it in the evening. That’s the pattern I adopted when I went into work and when I was thrown into a consulting situation which I hadn’t asked for because like Russ I’m an introvert so standing in front of people I don’t know and telling them what to do didn’t come naturally to me (it still doesn’t which is why I don’t do it). But I learn that there are actually different kinds of workplaces because I saw so many different companies, and there are actually some people who are successfully changing systems. So over the past 20 years I learnt an important lesson in terms of why we underestimate our chances to change a system. It’s because we very, very much underestimate our own ability to change ourselves. You’ve probably all heard the Ghandi quote who said "Be the change you want to see" and he’s also shown us how hard that is, how much pain you may endure if you really want to have sustainable change. And I truly believe that change always starts with me and any change of a system I’m going to be a part of, even as a coach, as a consultant or whatever, it’s going to involve my own transformation first.

So why do we underestimate our own ability to change? I’ve been looking into a mirror, honestly, multiple times in my life. I didn’t like what I saw. It was not as beautiful as what that mirror is showing. What I basically saw was that the assumption I grow up with as a teenager that I don’t need to be arrogant because I know I'm better than the rest wasn’t really showing. I didn’t really dare to tell that to anybody, it wasn’t a helpful sentence to begin with, I was young. But over time I saw that many people although they know in their head that they’re not very bad, that they are kind, intelligent, helpful, etc. they don’t dare to acknowledge that they’re special, that they’re worthy, that they are allowed to be kind to themselves. And this seems to be a struggle that we all have. So how does that happen?

Why are we so afraid to show ourselves?  Why does it hurt us so much to even think of talking about ourselves authentically, openly without any agenda or mask or persona that we push out in front of us? Where’s that pain coming from? There is medical research that shows that a lot of pain in human beings, a lot of illness, is created because a conflict between two main drives in human beings: one is the drive for authenticity, the drive for our own goals, the drive to be ourselves as much as we can be, and the other drive which is in conflict with that is the drive for attachment.

We don’t dare to show ourselves because we want to be successful, we want to be liked or loved, we want to survive and we constantly have this feeling and also make the experience that as soon as we dare to step out of our masks, of our habits, of the expectations that we assume other people to have, that they will hurt us. So we bend, we bend into roles, we bend into expectations, we create habits, and even when the situation that brought this habit into being is long past and the influences are not working anymore, are not relevant anymore, We still keep that behavior although it doesn’t make us successful now. So we create false identities because we sacrifice authenticity for attachment and in a corporate context that leads to a very, very big dysfunction, a big dysfunction that in my experience is the biggest source of waste we have in society and organizations and that’s why I’m interested in talking about it, in sharing my thinking about it and helping you to spot it and to work on it.

When we enter an organization we have someone pay us for our presence. We trade a certain amount of our own freedom for safety. (You are allowed to "boo" if I mention this word.) I think that is OK, right? I want to get paid every month so I give up a certain amount of control over what I do, how I spent my time to the organization that pays me. It’s a fair deal. I think that in many situations we are not entirely honest and not fully conscious about how much we give up for what in return. And the result is that we are scared because we are trying to fit into something we didn’t choose. We chose the workplace but we didn’t actively, consciously choose all the things that came with it and we have a hard time dealing with all the judgment that is so prevalent in our society and in our workplace, right? We are assessed, we are compared, things are right, things are wrong, things are good, things are bad. Very, very often this is not situational in a context where it could be helpful, very often this is a very general judgment and that leads to shame. Shame is one of the most powerful emotions, one of the most powerful drives, and it’s very, very painful so we try to avoid it. And the dynamics that are created are called oppression. Oppression is according to Augusto Boal “a situation where there is only monologue although there could be dialogue”. And this is exactly what I’m talking about. When we enter the workplace, there isn’t an explicit contract to trade my time and my presence and my creativity for money and there’s multiple dimensions for this. There are a whole load of expectations, many of whom I probably make up because I don’t ask what people expect. And all of that stuff that we don’t talk about, all of the freedom I give up that is not explicit, that is not conscious, is oppressive. And this is harmful and this creates waste.

  The waste it creates in organizations is politics. Politics is all the time and energy we spend not on results but on covering our asses. Making sure we look good, making sure the data looks right, making sure somebody else is responsible, right? Somebody else’s problem, are you familiar with that dynamic? Right. I honestly think that processes and roles are mainly in place to ensure this. If we have long lists of RACI, responsibility matrixes etc. We know that it’s not my fault. So I won’t be blamed and I don’t need to feel shame.

 I want to do a quick test with you. Could you stand up? I know we’ve done that already but this is the after lunch standing up and if someone actually asked you again the question you were asked in the morning why you do the stand up I give you one good answer: the brain gets 20% more oxygen when you’re standing up, so it’s especially good when you’re getting tired. My friend Michael coined the term politics tax for the percentage of time and energy people in an organization spend on covering their ass instead of focusing on results. So a few questions: how much of your energy, how much of your time do you spend on looking good, do you spend on making sure something is not your fault, to bend data to fit expectations, to cover up bad news or to cover thine ass? Please sit down if the amount of energy that you spend in your organization is below 20%. Wow I’m impressed! Below 50%? 80%? Thank you for being so honest! In a talk at a conference in Berlin last year actually 2 guys were still standing up when I asked below 80% and I talked to them afterwards, they were really in a lot of pain.

What’s the choice we have? You ‘re familiar with the matrix, right? Red pill, blue pill, do you want to continue pretending or do you want to have a look at reality and see how far the rabbit hole goes? Do you want to open up, have an honest conversation, talk on eye level, get the roles, the expectations, all the habits to the side, see each other as a human being and see what we can do to achieve what we want to? That’s the choice we have. So who of you is familiar with real options? Ok. Few of you. Real options is a system that you can use on multiple levels. The first level is for decision making, second level is for getting awareness of where in your life, in your language, in your thinking there’s still coercion that stops you from doing what you want to do and lets you do what you have to do or think you have to do. And there are multiple other levels as well. I’ll cover these two. 

The first statement is "Options have value." That means the different things you could do are valuable, maybe in different ways. It also means on another level that it’s valuable to have options. You don’t want to be in the corner like this guy, right? The worst situation you can be in is when you don’t have a choice anymore or when the only choice you have is between different bad options. We had an election in Germany two weeks ago. That was a situation I really did not like.

The next interesting thing about options is that they expire and it helps to be aware of how long an option is valid. I chose this picture because sometimes expiring options can also transform into new options or a different kind of option which can be very interesting. I’ll cover that in a minute.

The third thing is be conscious and aware of your commitments. That’s where the coercion comes in. I bought a movie ticket, I have to go to the cinema. No. A movie ticket is an option. You can go to the cinema or you can spend your evening with a more valuable choice if that comes up after you bought the ticket. I have to go to work at 8 o’clock every day. No, you don’t! You won’t die if you don’t. The only things we have to do are breathe, die and pay taxes, most of us, right? The rest is choice. And the whole interesting thing about Real Options for me is getting more and more awareness of when we have a choice and why we make it. Phrased differently: let things emerge, rather than focusing on the things you need to do, have to do, etc. Focus on changing the context so that beautiful things can emerge. Be open to what’s coming at you. Trust that what can happen will happen! It’s true that options expire but in a complex environment new options will pop up in the next minute and make sure you’re aware of what is coming so that you can make use of it and exploit them.

Run experiments and celebrate failure, right? A commitment doesn’t mean I’m committed to do this thing for the rest of my life or for the rest of the project. Make sure that you can change your mind, make sure to create frames, safe-to-fail experiments so that you can learn. That’s where the culture comes in, right? How we deal with learning, how we deal with failure, how we deal with experimentations.

If you want to new more about Real Options, there’s a great book. One of the greatest business novels I’ve ever read by Olav Maassen and Chris Matts. It’s called "Commitment" available on Amazon and elsewhere, highly recommended.

So what are the options we have now? We have this problem of politics, of spending so much time individually and as organizations to pretend, to not look at the facts, not look at the truth, not dare to be open, not dare to be honest. What are our options, what can we do? Some practical ideas. 

Reminder of the problem: we’re afraid and being afraid is not a very good state to be in to act. So the first thing that I’m going to recommend is **share your fear**. Share what you’re afraid of, open up a little more, trust and find people that have the same issue and talk about that. The greatest thing to overcome fear is to stop feeling alone, as soon as you get out there and share. "This is the story of my work life. I became a manager, a boss of a company with about 50 people when I was nearly 30. I hadn’t lost for the job. I obviously gladly took it. I was young and needed the money, etc. and I found out that I had no clue what to do as a manager. I had no idea. The only thing I knew it was I was not meant to ask because I was the boss. That's a situation to be in. If I had known this (pointing at slide) back then, I would have asked for help, I would have asked other people, my co-boss who came into the very same situation as surprisingly as I had. I didn’t have any conversation with him, I just assumed he would do better and tried to keep up. 

Story telling. The more we share about the experiences we make, the fears we have, the struggles we have, the successes we have, the more people can resonate and chime in with their stories. This again contributes to the not feeling alone thing and it enables learning because we get multiple perspectives. And the multiple perspectives allow us to change our story. Someone was telling me in the break that he uses a scene from an animated movie to let people think differently about their situation and their team. So an animated movie with different funny characters and the people on the team then pick the characters: who’s who. Oh, he’s acting like that guy, he’s acting like that guy. Oh, I’m acting like that guy, funny. They’re getting a new perspective, they can choose a new story. They can change their reality by picking a different story to explain it. The human brain is quite malleable that way. Use that. 

Sometimes it also helps to just focus on what influences your perspective, right? I told you the story about my parents and how they shaped my expectations in the work place, to realize that, to then talk to them, to talk to other people: very powerful, very helpful.  

I developed a kind of feedback. It’s called hero feedback, to offer a hero for the story of a friend, of a colleague as a present. For instance somebody might remind me of Sam the hobbit in the Lord of the Rings. Very helpful, very considerate, very brave but he is always in the second row so people don’t see him. People don’t recognize his contribution to the story. For that colleague, he makes that impression on me and makes me give him a new perspective on how he works, how he acts as a team member and he may say, oh maybe I’d rather like to be like Pippin, make a few jokes or whatever, right? These stories help. Story telling is very powerful. This is just one specific method you can use.

Temenos is a container for story telling. It’s a method I’ve used for about a year now, with nearly 500 people. Every time it’s a profound experience where people come back and say "Wow. I profoundly changed my own perspective on my life” because this container basically contains what I’ve already mentioned: story telling, sharing the influences that shaped your expectations and habits, how you think about life at work. Then sharing how you experience the current situation, how you work together, how do I disappoint my team, how does my team disappoint me, very powerful thing to share in a team. And then, once you’ve seen where your expectations and habits come from, which of these fit now then enables you to look into the future and say “Ok, which of these things do I actually want to continue, do I want to develop and which of these do I want to let go of?"

Another gift I got from my parents, they gave me a lot of humbleness and a very, very low self-esteem. I decided about a year ago that the humbleness is very good, serves me well and that the low self esteem can just go right back under the Christmas tree, I don’t need it any more. And that was a very helpful and easy decision after I realized it this way.

One thing we are in general very afraid of and which in my experience has been very powerful for me and people I worked with, is to disclose more of ourselves than we usually do. A method or a set of methods you can use to do that are the Core Protocols, but there are other ways you can use as well: talk about yourself, right? Don’t buy into this bullshit of "don’t bring your personal life into work". Right? That only creates insanity, trust me. Share what you need, share what you want, do that in your team so that you actually find out what you want and the funny, very obvious but hidden from many people, news is when you know you want where you’re able to articulate it you chances to get it actually increase by a magnitude. Very, very simple tip, but you need to share to find out.

Another very simple tip, another one of the Core Protocol by the way: ask for help. It‘s not usual, it’s not normal and it’s so helpful. Whenever you’re stuck or even before you get stuck ask somebody to help you. Most people are glad to help, helping makes people happy. The expectations that we have and the myth that we are kind of taught when we are small, that people think less of ourselves when we ask them for help, is a myth. Ask someone for help and in most cases they will gladly help you and you will be so much better off in the end.

One last piece of advice. You know where a bottleneck is located in a bottle? So in any system, if it’s a hierarchy, look for the bottleneck: leaders go first. So if you are in charge of a company, if people follow you because they think you are a leader or maybe you are in a leadership position: your change will enable them to change and will make things so much easier and smoother if you start to open up and start to be honest if you start to ask for help. What I didn’t dare when I was a boss myself. Try that, it is immensely powerful. If you do that that’s my value proposition for you, you will get what you want at least much more of it, even though you don’t know what it is, you will much better than now know who you are because you get all these perspective and all of this sharing and this reflection and I want you to be proud. I want you to be proud of yourself as a human being and go out and change the world. It is not as hard as you thought it is or as you might think it is.

Stay weird, normal is overrated! 

There is one more thing, if you happen to use some rugby inspired practice in your organization it’s not about this thing, it’s about the ball. Thank you!
